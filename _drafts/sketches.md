Such trade-offs are made based on risks. When the risk of data loss is critical, for example as with a health-care solution, then multiple redundancy mechanisms are brought into the solution. In a different instance where the risk of not having some data immediately available in the system is relatively low, like with a reporting system, the architecture would encourage the use of eventual consistency.

- The Perceived Overhead of Writing Tests: Many opponents to TDD argue that spending time writing tests upfront negatively impacts productivity. However, numerous studies have shown that this is not true. Investing time in writing quality tests upfront can save developers days, or even weeks, of debugging and refactoring in the future.
- The Inability to Write Comprehensive Tests: It's impossible to write exhaustive tests that cover every possible scenario. Sometimes, bugs slip through the tests and end up breaking the code in production, causing frustration for developers. However, this is not an excuse to skip writing tests altogether. Instead, developers should aim to write comprehensive tests to cover the most critical use cases, and supplement them with manual testing and monitoring in production.
- Fear of Learning a New Workflow: TDD requires a change in a developer's workflow, which can be daunting. It's essential to recognize that any change requires a learning curve and can be uncomfortable at first. However, investing time to learn TDD can lead to huge dividends in terms of code quality and productivity.

DRY is about knowledge - not code

No one cares about your architecture.   
    The user's don't see it. The only see the capabilities the architecture gives them - Is it performant, Does it have less down-time, easily maintainable etc.
    The capabilities come from how the system is put together.

It is more so for software as the separation of hardware and software happened to facilitate quicker change.
 - enable the functionality to be changed without the need to change the underlying electronics.

I don't fancy reminding myself once a year that I'm closer to death than I was ever before and then eating lots of sugar to ensure so. It is like a self-fulfilling prophecy.
So, I invent sayings like "age is just a number" and "young at heart".

This is an alternative way of thinking about Big O Notation, from Tennessee-based cloud engineer Josh Carroll.
 O(1) = O(yeah)
 O(log n) = O(nice)
 O(n) = O(ok)
 O(n²) = O(my)
 O(2ⁿ) = O(no)
 O(n!) = O(mg!)

George Studenko talks about in a recent [article on medium](https://betterprogramming.pub/5-mistakes-i-did-as-a-developer-during-my-15-years-career-26527fc50895) talks about 5 mistakes that he made in a 15 year long career.
1. Sticking to a Single Programming Language
2. Staying Too Long in the Same Company
3. Developing a Product I Didn’t Really Like
4. Being in My Zone of Comfort for Too Long
5. Work for Someone Who Didn’t Appreciate Me

The ironic thing is all these mistakes are non-technical. That means there are many people from different domains making these same mistakes.


- HRBP vs Full-stack engineeer
    HRBP is the person who provides HR solutions on behalf of HR to an assigned unit/department. S/he handles the end to end HR operation - in broad we call it the processes of the joiner, mover and leaver. Basically, the HRBP acts as a single point of contact for HR matters, leads HR initiatives, acts as a change champion, expert in administration and compliance, and acts as an employee advocate for the particular unit assigned.
    For example, Sandali is the HRBP for the Product team. So, anyone in the product team has an issue, concern, advice or even a document request from HR; she is the contact point. In any case, she cannot provide a solution; she will escalate it to me! From Sandali's side, her contribution is measured when she ensures that her team is happy and comfortable reaching her! Also, since she is focused on a set of employees, she knows inside and out to make conscious decisions. It also makes life easy for the teams, rather than getting confused with the point of contact in HR.
