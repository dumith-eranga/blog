User Experience (UX for short) is an aspect that a development team must focus on when finalising a product before sending it to the end users. The graphical interface, the layout and spacing, or the colours and animations are some elements to consider for a software solution that is intended to be used by general clientele.

However, not all software is intended for everyday users. At times, the target audience of a software solution is developers. While factors like layout, colours, or graphical interfaces can matter in some instances, traits like extensibility, ease of integration, machine readability of output, and following established conventions are more significant. Since they are distinct from the traditional set of parameters evaluated for user experience, such attributes are categorised as components of Developer Experience (DX). 

Understanding the subtle and prominent variations between DX and UX is crucial for building a good software solution, for different clients weights qualities differently. The easiest place to start is by asking questions to understand the type of users and the problems the software is expected to solve.

1. Who are the intended users of this software or feature?
2. How would they use this?
