# Pride

Event though seeing their student doing well is indeed a cherishable moment of a teacher's life, it is not the proudest moment. Just like a parent's happiest moment is seeing their child succeeding and doing better than themselves, the pinnacle of a teachers career is the moment when the student teaches the teacher. The teacher take humble pride in knowing that their guidence had propelled the student to become a master and reach a level that they themselves had not. The teacher feels one with their heart and claims silently, "Yay! I did what I set out to do".

The proudest moment of a teacher's life is when the student teaches the teacher.
There was a short but massively inspirational speech by @sam during the Procyons sprint retrospective today. Thank you Sam for all the wisdom you share with your mentees.
I too was immensely inspired by your words. I believe your short speech held the key to solving a personal conundrum I am faced with. Thank you for reminding me of a lesson I have forgotten over time.
