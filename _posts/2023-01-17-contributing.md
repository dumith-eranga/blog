In #softwareengineering domain, there is a big emphasis on reuse. Many good pieces of code are available as open-source projects for the community to use in their projects. While there are some companies maintaining such projects, in most cases, they are maintained by individual engineers or small groups of the community.

Contributing to open-source projects is a great way to learn, network and enjoy. Firstly, reading code from different engineers that comes together harmoniously to form a beautiful product not only gives one a window to look into their minds but also a great way to familiarise oneself with different problems encountered which hardened the product. Secondly, when one contributes, they will be communicating with maintainers and other contributors. They are like-minded people and over time such interactions solidify as networks, giving one access to a wider pool of resource persons that can be consulted in need. Lastly, one doesn't voluntarily contribute to open-source projects unless they enjoy doing so. In turn it becomes a self-reinforcing activity giving one more pleasure as they keep contributing more and seeing they work is helping others.
