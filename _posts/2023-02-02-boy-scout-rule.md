A great engineering culture is one of the top criteria being considered when evaluating a potential employer. In addition to numerous strategies that the management can implement to ensure the presence of conducive ethos, the "Boy Scout Rule" is a basic yet highly effective tactic that a development team can follow to guarantee an environment where constant improvement is valued. 

Succinctly, it states that one strives to leave the parts (the code, the design, or the architecture) they touch (as a part of a feature development or a defect fix) in a better state than they found it. This simple notion not only gives the opportunity for the software engineers to show their proactivity but also make the products they work on more robust and efficient. Over time, engineering attitude gets ingrained in the culture making the organisation a dream environment for those who are looking for continuous improvement.
