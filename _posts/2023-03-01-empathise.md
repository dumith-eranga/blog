Building a good software product is no easy task. Over time many practices, techniques, and guidelines have been created to make this daunting activity more structured and methodical. In addition, the masters in the industry convert their tacit knowledge into many useful tips as a way of imparting their wisdom to juniors.

Among all those, one critical strategy is putting on the end user's shoes. Empathising with the end user not only does allow an engineer to build the product better, but also makes it more useful. Understanding the customer need, including the hidden ones, help the developer make the solution more fitting making it more attractive to the customers and in turn leading to higher and long-term revenue.

Care must be taken to identify the correct category of clients for the product being built as the traits they value are diverse. The majority of the time, it is the non-technical business users or the general public and what they value is collectively called User Experience (UX). On the other hand, there are products where the end users are developers and the the characteristics they adore is typically termed Developer Experience (DX).
