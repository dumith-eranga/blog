Despite being highly sought out, true green-field projects are [largely non-existent](2023-02-23-brownfield.md) in the software engineering domain. The primary reason is the extremely low barrier to entry. Due to its cost and resource efficiency, any software product one can think of could be tried out easily. This leads to a situation where almost every conceivable product has already been tried out, even multiple times.

A better way for a software engineer to find invigorating work is to seek innovation. Innovation happens when components from different domains are brought together in support of an idea that is marketable. In a truly innovative software project, the products keep evolving in response to both technical and non-technical factors such as changes in customer requirements, the scale of the solution, the changes in business, or new improvements in technology.
