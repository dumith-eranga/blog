In software engineering, there is a big emphasis on reuse. Libraries and frameworks are developed to foster code reuse across various software applications as opposed to writing from scratch. This is a win-win for both the developers of new applications and the authors of the library or the framework. While the former is benefitted by the reduction in development time, the latter gains opportunity to battle-test their work. Even though there are paid reusable code available (via licensing), open-source ones have far wider adoption due to cost considerations as well as extensive community support.

Such open-source products were once the work of some engineer or a team that was being done in order to achieve a particular functionality for a product they were building. Interestingly, the moment they stopped to think whether their work can make someone else's life better was when the magic happened and the world became a little bit better place.

A senior #softwareengineer asks the question "can the work I'm doing benefit someone else as well?". This cajole them to release their work as open-source projects where possible.
