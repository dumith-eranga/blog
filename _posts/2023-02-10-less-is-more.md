Excessive choice can create problems. Selecting the right programming language for a project becomes difficult when there are more than a handful of potential candidates. The situations with application frameworks are similar. Overabundance can lead to paralysis by analysis or unnecessary complexities and complications.

This is quite common in modern day software development.

There are certain principles that allow one to limit the options and focus on doing the work with just the essentials.

Some of them are :
- Principle of least privilege results in more security
- Principle of least knowledge (law of demeter) results in more fluent design
- Rule of least power results in more utility of data and code

At times, less is more.
