Unlike many traditional professions, #softwareengineering domain is has a rapid pace of change. Under such circumstances, it is extremely challenging to keep abreast with innovations happening across the spectrum, let alone master them by oneself. That is why there is a strong community. In fact, it is not a single collective but a amalgamation of many, focusing on different subdomains of interest to them.

A community can only grow proportionately to the contribution of its members. Among the variety of ways to contribute, participating in open knowledge sharing sessions is one of the easiest. These meetups, as they are called in certain circles, are mini events where like-minded people gather to discuss, learn from each other and network. Despite whether one is an expert or a complete newbie, such events give the opportunity to learn something new every time - perhaps by sharing one's knowledge and describing experiences or by listening to others speak.
