When the manifesto for agile software development was published in 2001, it took the world by storm. In the aftermath, Scrum became one of the popular frameworks for software development teams. While it is said to be practised by many organisations, some inadvertently deviate from the guidelines and end up not getting benefited from the framework or at times accomplishing pain rather than help. Such malpractices are mockingly called ScrumBut (or ScrumButt).

One of the easy elements to diverge from is the Sprint Retrospective ceremony.

Firstly, it may seem unnecessary to the stakeholders as the sprint work is already done. Their incentive generally is on starting the next sprint at the earliest possibility to keep the development team busy and churning out features or fixes. However, this break is as essential to a proper scrum team as taking the hands off the steering wheel to switch gears to a race-car driver - without it, adapting to road conditions ahead becomes harder. The solution is to have firm servant leadership in the team, maybe in the form of a scrum master, and insist on this time off.

Secondly, the retrospection can become habitual, mechanical, and monotonic. Overusing the start-stop-continue template is an easy trap to fall into and end up here. The most important outcome of the retrospection is the discussion and the action items that get raised. Oftentimes, the mechanical approach will yield suboptimal outcomes due to a lack of meaningful action items. The easiest technique to mitigate this is to employ a different format once every few sessions.
