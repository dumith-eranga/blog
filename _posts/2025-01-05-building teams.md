Team building is both a science and an art. A high-functional team had many roles and varying degrees of expertise. The methods of bootstrapping teams can be grouped under two broad categories.

The first is what one can call the "organic" method. Here, individuals are chosen by looking for acceptable levels of performance and expertise along with the mindset and the willingness to be trained and upskilled. In general, it is better to have a long-term horizon when using this method as the idea is to evolve the team into the ideal formation and level of performance by continuous guidance, feedback, and mentoring. Over time, the members will transform themselves to play the roles that best match their preferences, talents, and interests. This is a great way to develop camaraderie innately.

The second approach can be dubbed "scaffolding". The leadership starts with a vision of what level of expertise and experience each role needs at the current juncture and then finds people that fit. This strategy is often used when the necessary attributes are clear and a short to medium-term tactic is warranted. Since experts are being hired, this usually costs more. When the business evolves and the needs change over time, the roles are replaced with different ones and existing members will either adapt or get replaced with new members. While the upside is the faster ROI on the team, some factors can inhibit the successful formation. For example, in a market where the required level of skill is not widely available, such a venture might take much longer or never come to full fruition. If played right, this is a great scale-up tactic by and large.

All in all, one must weigh the pros and cons of each alternative when establishing their next team. Aspects like market conditions, available budget, time horizon to achieve peak performance, and even cultural nuances must be taken into account when selecting an approach. Sometimes, the sweet spot lies in employing a combination of both and finding the right balance.
