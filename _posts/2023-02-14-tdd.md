When there is pressure to increase code coverage of unit tests, it is easy to resort to packing as many tests as possible into the least possible amount of code when a testing framework supports parameterised tests. While it has the appearance of code reuse, it is in fact abuse. One good example is the presence of both positive and negative tests bundled together.

An easy mechanism to circumvent is the use of Test-Driven Development (TDD). The 3 rules of TDD prohibits adding more than one test - all existing tests must pass before adding a new one. The TDD cycle limits the scope of refactoring to existing code and tests - never to facilitate new tests. Thus, any temptation to sneak-in several tests can easily be identified as a malpractice by the developers themselves.

The 3 rules of TDD are:
1. Write production code only to pass a failing unit test.
2. Write no more of a unit test than sufficient to fail (compilation failures are failures).
3. Write no more production code than necessary to pass the one failing unit test.

The TDD cycle is:
1. Write a new test
2. Make the test pass
3. Refactor
