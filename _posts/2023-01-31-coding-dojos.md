Software engineering is a team game. It is not the one with award winning players that perform the greatest in a team sport, it is the team that puts out the best concerted effort. Achieving perfect tandem requires a significant investment in practice. It enables the group to understand each other's strengths and competencies and develop harmony. Thus, similar to practice sessions that a troupe, a band, or a squad does, an engineering team needs a designated place and a time to make such sessions consistent and effective.

Coding Dojos are a great way to achieve this camaraderie and concord. The idea is that the team gathers at a designated place, usually inside the company premises, regularly and rehearses the skills necessary for their day-to-day work, more intensely and under more autonomy. The beginning of a sprint or when picking up a large task is a good trigger for a Coding Dojo session. For greater benefit, the team can invite a technical lead or an architect to observe and provide feedback - similar to what a coach would do for a sports team.
