Security is a crucial element of good software, if not the most critical. Between the myriad of techniques for securing software systems and the cacophony of advice and guidance, the underlying concept can be summarised in just three words - **verify before trust**.

The following examples illustrate how this can be applied in development work.

- When an input is received from the user interface, _verify it_ by running through a sanitizer, _before_ sending it to the database.

- When an HTTP request comes to the web application, _verify_ whether it has the expected HTTP verb and the payload structure, _before_ handling the request.

- When a user requests some information via the API, _verify_ whether it is a genuine user (authentication) and whether they have permission to access the data being requested (authorization), _before_ returning the details.

The beauty lies in the simple yet ubiquitous nature of this principle. 

It can be applied beyond just software development to any scenario where trust cannot be established directly. For instance, when a request is received through an insecure communications channel like a Slack message, say for some internal financial document of the organization, the recipient can use a secondary communication channel like a phone call to verify the authenticity of the request (and the requester) before sharing it across.
