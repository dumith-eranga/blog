Starting on a clean slate is a software developer's dream. That allows them to set up everything the way they want and establish the exact toolchains and workflows they desire. Despite many engineers sharing this fantasy, rarely do they get a chance to do so. This is a dream so vivid that usually such projects are called "green field" ones to symbolise the virgin ground upon which the things will be built.

As information technology has permeated all domains imaginable by now, it is next to impossible to find a truly green field project. Instead, what is found almost always is a "brownfield", a ground upon which previously has been built. To an engineer it means that they would be using many of the existing tools, copying existing solutions from other domains, and adapting designs and architecture that are already in use elsewhere.

However, this is not necessarily a bad thing. A brownfield indicated that the ground is solid - the tools have been battle-tested, the solutions have been refined over many iterations, and the designs and architectures have been simplified to the bare necessities.
