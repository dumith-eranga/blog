Regardless of how experienced or technically skilled they are, there are instances where a software engineer could use an extra pair of eyes when working on a complex problem or when debugging to fix a tricky defect. Even though such help is available usually in a team setting, that might not always be the case due to other factors. For example, engineers working remotely or in asynchronous teams may come across such limitations more frequently.

One way to overcome such constraint is to mimic the presence of a second person using a prop. The most popular one used is a rubber duckling, giving this technique its iconic name "rubber duck debugging". The practitioner of this technique talks to the inanimate object of their choice, assuming it is a person, and explaining what they are doing, what they think they should do, or how they think the code they are reading works. They even ask questions from this "rubber duck". The process of talking to a second person allows one to observe their thought process objectively and by doing so discover new insights. Oftentimes, this enables them to solve complex problems or identify the causes behind tricky defects that they are working on.

The beauty of this tactic lies in its simplicity and versatility. It is quite easy to practice and requires almost no setup or preparation. In addition, the same strategy can be used to level up in skill, for the capacity of an engineer grows as they learn to communicate better - be it with a computer using programming languages or with other humans they encounter as co-workers, teammates, or stakeholders of the project.
