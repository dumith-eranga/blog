title: "How vs Why"
date: 2023-01-02

A junior #softwareengineer asks the questions:
1. What?
2. How?
3. When?

in that order.

A senior asks;
1. What?
2. Why?
3. When?

in that order.

The difference is the replacement of "how" with the "why".

**Trait 1:** Proactive work.   
A senior doesn't wait for others to tell them how to do things. They propose options and improve the proposals based on feedback. 

**Trait 2:** Critical evaluation.   
A seniors verifies that there is a compelling reason and they understand it properly, before starting work.
