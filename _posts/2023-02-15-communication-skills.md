The most important role that a software engineer plays is that of a communicator. While they are seen acting as translators between the user requirement and the code that a computer can execute, it is only the surface. To be effective at work, there are other facets of communication necessary.

An eloquent engineer possesses communication skills in three broad categories.

1. Natural/human language - for verbal and written communications through meetings, presentations, reports, articles, documentation, or manuals.
2. Modelling language - for visualising technical details such as schematic diagrams (architecture, infrastructure, ER, UML, etc.), charts (flow, Gantt, etc.), or even pseudo-code.
3. Computer language - for communicating with computers using programming code or no-code variants

Each one is equally important. Imbalance can hinder career growth.
