As the domain of software engineering keeps growing, each role in the domain expands. When the responsibilities for a role widen beyond the grasp of a single person, it inevitably has to split. The role of an architect is no exception. Thus, one can find different flavours of architects in today's world.

- Solution / Software Architects are in charge of the technical design and architecture of products. They often lead developers.

- Enterprise Architects deal with the overall big-picture of products but do not drill into the implementation details much.

- Functional Architects are primarily handling the business side of the products and processes. Typically, they are well experienced Business Analysts who design & lead business-logic of software products.

- Domain Architects work on specific sub-domains within the industry or handle specialised use cases. For example, there are Cloud Architects, Data Architects, Mobile Architects, UI/UX Architects and more.,

Having an understanding of available options and personal preferences is a definite benefit if a software engineer has the ambition to become an architect as their career progresses.
