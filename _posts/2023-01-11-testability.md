title: "Testability Focus"

When a senior #softwareengineer is given a task, they always ask from themselves "how can I test this". They understand that the best way to prove that they have done the work right is to test it.

**Trait:** Focus on Testability

They do not do it because they are asked to do so. The proof they are giving is to themselves - not necessarily to others. The proof is what gives them the confidence and the satisfaction of a job well done.

This approach allows the senior engineer to use techniques like Example Mapping and Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) to discover hidden requirements in order to develop a well-fitting solution. Further, it encourage incremental development through techniques like Test-First Development (TFD) or Test-Driven Development (TDD).
