You are at odds with colleagues over tech trends. How do you ensure your projects stay on track?

A simple yet effective framework I use in such situations has 4-steps.

1. Establish a baseline

    Pick the few technologies that all parties can agree on. This forms the core tech stack upon which the rest of the work is built.

2. Decide the tolerance for innovation

    Understanding what the deliverable deadlines are and choosing how innovative we want to be helps us identify the tolerance level.

3. Make quantitative decisions within that tolerance

    Evaluate any new technology to be adopted by considering the change in the implementation effort and the impact of it on the delivery deadline.

4. Plan for new technology adoption

    Any technology that cannot be accommodated now need not be completely discarded. Agreements can be reached to consider them sooner or later or at least given a fair chance by running experiments. These can be added to the backlog as future tasks. This last step ensures that no idea gets shot down.

"Innovation Tokens" is a great tool to help decide on an acceptable tolerance level and enforce it.
