When at odds with colleagues over tech trends, how does one ensure the projects stay on track?

Here is one simple yet effective framework.

1. Establish the baseline

    Pick the few technologies on which all parties can agree. This will form the core tech stack upon which the rest of the work is built.

2. Decide the tolerance for innovation

    Understanding what the deliverable deadlines are and choosing the acceptable leeway for innovation will help identify the tolerance level.

3. Make quantitative decisions within that tolerance

    Evaluate any new technology to be adopted by considering the change in the implementation effort and the impact on the delivery deadline.

4. Plan for new technology adoption

    Any technology that cannot be accommodated immediately need not be completely discarded. Agreements can be reached to consider them sooner or later or at least given a fair chance by running experiments. These can be added to the backlog as future tasks. This last step ensures that no idea gets shot down.

Tip: "Innovation Tokens" is a great tool for enforcing the acceptable tolerance level on a project.
