A software engineering student almost always comes across design patterns when they are learning theoretical aspects. While there are many fancy ways of describing what they are, in its essence, a design pattern is a standardised solution to a particular software design problem. If an engineer can break a design problem (that they are dealing with) into a collection of such identified problems, the design patterns can help them arrive at a robust overall solution faster.

Though design patterns are the most commonly used term, in #softwareengineering, we encounter the same concept at other layers as well. For instance, coding patterns are standardised ways of writing code under certain circumstances. Similarly architectural patterns are standardised solutions to identified architectural problems.
