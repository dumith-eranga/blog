One doesn't become a senior #softwareengineer by just working as an engineer for a long time - it only can make them experienced engineers. 

Trait : Benevolence
A senior engineer emerges when they take juniors under their wing. Regardless of whether assigned officially or not, one can help-out, guide, teach, coach, and mentor juniors.

One doesn't need the title of "senior engineer" in order to become one - it is a change that happens within.

**Note:** Here "a junior" refers to a person without experience on one or more areas relevant to the work being done.
