In the software development domain, a range of companies can be seen based on the type of business they do. An employee can find enjoyable work and the career growth they desire if they can identify where they fall in the spectrum.

On one end there are software houses that manufacture and sell software for other companies to use. They mainly work on a project basis and could be working on an assortment of projects at any given time.

Working for a software house as a #softwareengineer is like dating. One gets to try out many technologies, programming languages, tools, and interact with many parties. They learn to love some, hate some, or be indifferent.

On the other end there are product companies who build their software products and sell the services of those. Nowadays they are popularly called Saas companies.

Working for a product company is like marriage. One gets to live and breathe the product, it's technology stack, ecosystem and the stakeholders. While they might still dislike some parts, they would learn to live with those and even enjoy certain imperfections intermittently.

Neither is necessarily better than the other. It all depends on one's point of view and what is palatable to them - not necessarily on age or any other demographic.
