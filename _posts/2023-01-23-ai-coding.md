We are on the verge of a paradigm shift in #softwareengineering. While innovations like GitHub's co-pilot herald the wave of change by introducing the use of AI assistance to code, ChatGPT and its contemporaries took it to the next level. It is only a matter of time where one gets to write a prompt for an AI engine as the source-code and a tool generates the respective code in a high-level programming language which then gets compiled to an executable. As we get more comfortable with using assistance from AI, the intermediate step will get dissolved. The journey that started decades ago with the invention of low-level programming languages will reach its culmination when the use of natural language for programming becomes the norm.

Continuing on the path taken by low-code and no-code initiatives, AI assisted coding makes programming accessible to a wider community - especially the ones towards the low end of the tech-savviness curve.
