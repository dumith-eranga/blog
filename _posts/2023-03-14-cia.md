Security in an information system is generally a secondary consideration for the average user. It only grabs their attention when a breach occurs. However, while developing, it must be the primary focus. Failure to do so can leave unidentified vulnerabilities open in a system and lead to devastating exploits of those.

The aspects to pay attention to regarding cyber security can be broadly grouped under three categories.
1. Confidentiality: only authorised users should have access to information.
2. Integrity: information must be up-to-date, complete, and reliable.
3. Availability: information should be accessible when needed.

Because the whole premise rests on these, sometimes they are called the three pillars of information security. Since it is only a balance between these factors that is achievable practically, not a hundred per cent adherence, they are also named the CIA triad.
