It is common observation that a senior engineer displays a great level of confidence in the work they are doing. This leads to the false assumption that confident is a result of seniority.

The truth is the reverse. One becomes a senior engineers because of confident.

The confidence doesn't come from being correct always. It comes from knowing that one can learn and recover from mistakes. It comes from honesty and courage to accept when one makes a mistake. It comes from not being afraid to make mistakes.

A senior #softwareengineer doesn't make less mistake than a junior. In contrast, they make more.
Because they know how to self-evaluate and self-correct, many of their mistakes are short-lived and not seen by anyone but themselves.

**Note:**   
TDD, for instance, is one technique of gaining confidence when coding. By the time a pull-request is submitted, the code had failed abundantly that almost all the failure scenarios have been identified and fixed. Thus the likelihood of failure in production is marginal.
