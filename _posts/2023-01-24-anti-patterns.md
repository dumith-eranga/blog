When a body of knowledge develops around a particular domain, certain recurring components can be observed. Good practices or ways of working are generally called “patterns”. In #softwareengineering domain, they are further classified depending on the level of abstraction. Coding patterns, design patterns, and architectural patterns are some good examples. By contrast, “anti-patterns” describe the wrong ways of doing things. They capture the knowledge about scenarios that can lead to doom in software projects. These anti-patterns are equally important as they are helpful in deterring engineers from implementing the obvious but incorrect solutions.

A seasoned engineer is aware of both. While they try to use patterns when appropriate, they also tread carefully to avoid anti-patterns.
