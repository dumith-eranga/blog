Software engineers love trying out new technical things. New programming languages, new tech stacks, new frameworks, or new tools - all catch attention due to this nature. However, trying out too many new things at once can severely impact the delivery of a project. Hence, this bravity needs reining in.

Though there are popular techniques like time-boxing, MVPs, and prototyping, innovation tokens is an interesting approach despite being less common. The idea is to limit the number of innovations by counting them as costs.

First, a tolerable limit is agreed upon. This can vary depending on factors like skills within the team, nature of the domain of the project, costs associated, or level of risk aversion. Next, the team is given the pre-agreed number of innovation tokens at the beginning of each iteration. Every time an innovation is incorporated into the deliverable one token is recorded as spent. If there are no remaining tokens, no further innovations can be brought in within the particular cycle.
