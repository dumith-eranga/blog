Low documentation is one of the traits promoted in modern software engineering practice. Not only does it enable faster output from developers by allowing them to focus more on building things than paperwork, but also eliminates the tendency of the code and the documentation to go out of sync over time. Here, the code acts as the single source of truth.

As a way to facilitate this, self-documenting code is written where the business logic can easily be inferred when reading the narrative style code. Comments, if at all present, are there only to describe why a certain behaviour should occur and are limited to occasions where the code fails to make it obvious.

However, this mechanism is insufficient to capture the higher-level decision rationales in the codebase as those transcend the scope of code and often records of discarded approaches are insightful as well.

One solution is Architectural Decision Records (ARDs). It provides a concise format to capture the reasoning behind particular design choices made and the trade-offs. Due to their simplicity, they can sensibly live in the same repository and fosters the notion of a single source of truth.
