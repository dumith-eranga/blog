All well-established professions have their standards. Simplest to explain yet one of the most impactful examples is from the accounting field. The concept of double entry is not only the standard but also an ethic for an accountant. Succinctly, it is the principle where any credit entry in one account is accompanied by one or more debit entries in a respective account that sums up to the same amount. Though elementary, this mechanism facilitates effortless cross-validation allowing the professionals to ensure the integrity of transactions entered.

In the software engineering domain, the corresponding practice is to have tests alongside production code. Any code change can be reflected on the test side to achieve a similar cross-validation effect.

Unfortunately, this is not yet the industry standard but only a de facto one. Therefore, it is easy to forego the test side and focus only on the production code aspect either due to ignorance or time pressure. One viable approach to instilling discipline is to adopt test-driven development (TDD). The first rule of TDD states that production code cannot be written without a failing test, ensuring the presence of tests that go with production code.
