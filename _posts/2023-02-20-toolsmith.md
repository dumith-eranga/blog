One way to identify a senior engineer from the rest is to look at the tools they are using. Even at the early stage of starting a new assignment, be it a new job at a new company or a new project at the same company, they spend time trying out different tools and choosing the ones that deliver the best user experience for them for the work. While the organisation or the project may dictate some of the terms on what can and cannot be used, due to both compliance reasons and the necessity to have everyone follow the same standard, there is still room to select the tools that improve the workflow for individuals.

Once chosen, however, they are not bound to the tools either. They constantly experiment with new tools they come to know of and keep adding them to their arsenal while replacing the old and weary with the new and sleek. They understand the tools are there to be used. Despite the appearance of confining one to a particular structure, a senior engineer knows that tools take care of the mundane, granting far greater freedom to work on the creative aspects of the project.

In situations where there are no readily available ones to fit a need, they build their own tools and share them with others. Many such tools with sufficient traction in the community tend to end up as popular open-source projects.

Senior engineers are toolsmiths. They make life better for everyone around them.
