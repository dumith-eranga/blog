Architecture is a crucial aspect of any software product. A software product starts as a figment of imagination first, which becomes a small sapling by manifesting itself as a code, and then can grow to be a behemoth if the right traction is achieved. Like wood gives structure to a tree throughout various stages of its life, software architecture does the same to software systems.

One facet of software architecture is tradeoffs. At every stage of development, when there are multiple options available, architecture acts as the guideline to choose one that fits our goal. For instance, a standalone desktop application following a layered architecture would opt for a flat file or a simple local database as opposed to a distributed and replicated database. In contrast, a SaaS solution built on cloud-native microservices architecture would inevitably select an auto-scaled distributed database with failover mechanisms. The choices here, the flat file, the local database, and the distributed database have their pros and cons. The architecture helps the developers to determine the right option to go for.
