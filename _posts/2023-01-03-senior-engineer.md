One way to identify a senior #softwareengieer among juniors is to pay attention to the language they use during discussions.

> We use `parseInt` to get the integer parameter coming via the URL string and check if it is in the `allowedUserIdList` in the `pendingInvoices` class.

> We extract the user id from the request URL and validate it against the allowed list for the pending invoices."

A junior would use a language containing programming code while a senior would use a language with concept words.

A person's language reflects their level of thinking.
Conversely, if one wants to raise themselves to a senior level, they can gain an upper hand by resorting to a higher level language - for their words influence their level of thinking in the long run.

_Note : The examples were intentionally made extreme in order to illustrate a point. People may neither utter the same words nor speak in the same manner in real life._
