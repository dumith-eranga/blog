In statistics (and evidently in data science), when you are dealing with time-series data sometimes we use a pair of tools called ACF and PACF. These tools transform the data-set into a different domain so that trends, seasonality and other patterns can be easily identified.

Similarly, in science, Fourier transformation is an invaluable tool for digital signal processing.

Likewise, a senior #softwareengineer uses abstract thinking to transform a problem into a different domain in which it is easier to design solutions. Once the design is finalised, the transformation is reversed while implementing the solution as code.

One simple mechanism for abstract thinking as a software engineer is the use of design patterns. They allow one to work with higher-level building blocks. Since there is only a handful of design patterns that are quite frequent, most of them have robust implementation available in most of the popular tech-stacks already. Thus the problem of implementing a solution gets reduced to a problem of finding the best way to connect components in many cases.
