title: "Technical Debt"

Technical debt is a term often mentioned in the context of good software engineering. The word has much negative connotation associated and hence creates pressure to avoid it. 

One way to look at technical debt is to consider it as the deviation between the understanding of how a software works and how it actually does. This model allows one to shift their point of view to be more aligned with the original intention when the word was coined.

When loans are taken in small quantities for small periods and paid back regularly, it causes no harm. In fact, such small financial debts allow one to quickly respond to urgent situations. When one of the parameters changes - quantity, period, or regularity of amortisation - things take a turn. If multiple parameters change for the worse, it becomes uncontrollable and chaos ensues.

Similarly, incurring minor short-lived technical debt with a stable pipeline for paying back enables fast reaction when delivering a software product, but, negligence, lack of discipline, and accumulation, when doing so, lead to an inevitable doom.

To help prioritize which technical debt to pay back first, following questions could be used.
- How far it deviates?
- How long have we had this?
- How frequently we attend to it?
