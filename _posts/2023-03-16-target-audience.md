Computers do not understand the programming code we write. They only understand machine language. The instructions we write need to get converted to machine language through compilers or interpreters before the machine can execute them.

Computer languages were developed to make it easier for humans. Starting from the low-level ones and moving to the mid-level and finally to the high-level languages we use today was all in the effort to make it friendly to the developer. 

The code we write is for humans. Good code reveals its intention to the reader. The closer the code looks to natural language and domain terminology, the easier it is to read and be understood. This is the underlying rationale for many of the paradigms like Object Oriented Programming (OOP), Domain-Driven Design (DDD), and Declarative Programming.

Senior engineers understand that buggy code with perfect grammar reveals its bugs faster than perfect code with bad grammar reveals its functionality. Thus they strive to write good code.
