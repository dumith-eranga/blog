title: "Markdown for Documentation"

Despite striving to have less documentation, certain situations require some documented information on technical considerations of software projects. For instance, new developers being onboarded may require setup instructions or the team may decide to keep architectural decision records (ADRs).

If the code repository acts as the single source of truth for a software product, it makes sense to store these documents in the same place. While plain text files are sufficient in most cases, opting for one that is simple yet supports formatting, like Markdown, can result in more visually appealing documentation with the help of a simple renderer. Due to the popularity of this, repository hosts like GitHub render Markdown seamlessly on their online UI. An added advantage of using Markdown is that, with a plugin like Mermaid, even technical diagrams can be embedded, making it comprehensive enough to cover most of the types of documents needed.
